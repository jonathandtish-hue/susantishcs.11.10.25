# Adding Ocean Waves Video Background

## Quick Instructions:

1. **Download a free ocean waves video** from one of these sources:

   ### Option 1: Pexels (Recommended)
   - Go to: https://www.pexels.com/search/videos/ocean%20waves/
   - Find a video you like (e.g., "Ocean Waves" by Engin Akyurt)
   - Click "Free Download" and select "HD (1920x1080)"
   - Save the file

   ### Option 2: Pixabay
   - Go to: https://pixabay.com/videos/search/ocean%20waves/
   - Choose a video
   - Click "Free Download" and select your preferred quality
   - Save the file

   ### Option 3: Mixkit
   - Go to: https://mixkit.co/free-stock-video/ocean-waves/
   - Browse and download a free video

2. **Rename the downloaded video** to: `ocean-waves.mp4`

3. **Move it to your website folder**:
   ```bash
   mv ~/Downloads/ocean-waves.mp4 /Users/jonathantish/Downloads/susantishcs-102425/website/
   ```

4. **Refresh your browser** at http://localhost:8888

## What to Look For:
- **Duration**: 10-30 seconds (will loop seamlessly)
- **Quality**: HD (1920x1080) or higher
- **Content**: Calm ocean waves, preferably from a beach perspective
- **File size**: 2-10 MB is ideal for web

## If Video Doesn't Load:
The site will show a nice blue gradient background as a fallback, so the site will still look great even without the video!
