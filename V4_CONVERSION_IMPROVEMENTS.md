## 🎯 Major Improvements

### 1. **Trust Signals**
**Problem**: No visual of the practitioner, no social proof  
**Solution**:
- Added professional photo placeholder for Susan with credentials
- Added 3 detailed testimonials with ratings and locations
- Included "12+ Years Experience" badges throughout
- Added "Response within 24 hours" commitment

### 2. **What I Help With Section**
**Problem**: Visitors couldn't quickly see if Susan could help their specific problem  
**Solution**:
- Created 6 clear category cards showing common issues:
  - Physical Health (chronic pain, injury healing)
  - Mental & Emotional (anxiety, depression, stress)
  - Relationships (marriage, family conflicts)
  - Life Transitions (career changes, decisions)
  - Grief & Loss (coping, comfort, moving forward)
  - And More (catch-all with CTA)
- Visual icons for each category
- Specific examples under each category

### 3. **Clear Process (How It Works)**
**Problem**: Unclear what happens when someone reaches out  
**Solution**:
- 4-step numbered process:
  1. Free Consultation (15 minutes, no commitment)
  2. Initial Session (discuss situation, begin treatment)
  3. Ongoing Treatment (continuous prayer, flexible sessions)
  4. Experience Healing (work together until results)
- Big, numbered steps with color-coded backgrounds
- Set clear expectations at each stage

### 4. **Pricing Information**
**Problem**: No mention of cost or payment  
**Solution**:
- Clear statement: "Fees are modest and affordable"
- "Insurance often covers Christian Science treatment"
- "Sliding scale available"
- Reduces fear/uncertainty about affordability

### 5. **Improved Hero Section**
**Problem**: Generic headline, no clear value proposition  
**Solution**:
- Powerful headline: "Find Lasting Healing Through Prayer"
- Specific subheadline: "Christian Science Practitioner helping people worldwide overcome physical illness, emotional challenges, and life difficulties"
- Three key benefits listed: "Remote sessions • Insurance coverage • Free consultation"
- Photo of Susan (placeholder) establishes personal connection
- Dual CTAs: Primary = "Start Free Consultation", Secondary = "How It Works"

### 6. **Better Calls-to-Action**
**Problem**: Generic "Contact" buttons without context  
**Solution**:
- All CTAs emphasize **FREE consultation**
- "Start Free Consultation" (removes risk)
- "Get Your Free Consultation" 
- Added context: "Free 15-minute consultation included with first inquiry"
- CTA sections explain what happens next

### 7. **Response Time Expectations**
**Problem**: No indication when visitor would hear back  
**Solution**:
- "I typically respond within 24 hours"
- "Leave a message, I'll call back within 24 hours"
- Clear expectations reduce anxiety about reaching out

### 8. **User-Focused Language**
**Problem**: Service-focused instead of benefit-focused  
**Solution**:
- Changed from "I offer spiritual healing" to "Find Lasting Healing"
- Changed from "Contact me" to "Ready to Begin Your Healing Journey?"
- Changed from "Services" to "What I Help With"
- Changed from "Spiritual Healing" nav to "How It Works"
- All copy answers "What's in it for me?"

### 9. **Contact Page Improvements**
