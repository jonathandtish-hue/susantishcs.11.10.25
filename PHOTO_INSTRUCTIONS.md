# How to Add Susan's Photo

## Quick Instructions:

1. **Save the photo** you provided (the hiking photo) to your computer
2. **Rename it** to: `susan-tish.jpg`
3. **Move it** to: `/Users/jonathantish/Downloads/susantishcs-102425/website/`
4. **Refresh** your browser at http://localhost:8080/

## Alternative: Use Terminal

If you have the photo saved somewhere, you can copy it:

```bash
# If your photo is on Desktop:
cp ~/Desktop/your-photo-name.jpg /Users/jonathantish/Downloads/susantishcs-102425/website/susan-tish.jpg

# Or if it's in Downloads:
cp ~/Downloads/your-photo-name.jpg /Users/jonathantish/Downloads/susantishcs-102425/website/susan-tish.jpg
```

## What I've Already Done:

✅ Updated the website code to use your real photo instead of the placeholder icon
✅ The photo will appear on:
   - Homepage hero section
   - About page

## Photo Requirements:

- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Size**: Recommended at least 800x800px (square works best)
